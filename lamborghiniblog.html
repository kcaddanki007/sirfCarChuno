        <dd>Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. (Italian pronunciation: [autoˈmɔːbili lamborˈɡiːni]) is an Italian brand and manufacturer
        of luxury sports cars and SUVs based in Sant'Agata Bolognese. The company is owned by the Volkswagen Group through its
        subsidiary Audi.
        
        Ferruccio Lamborghini, an Italian manufacturing magnate, founded Automobili Ferruccio Lamborghini S.p.A. in 1963 to
        compete with Ferrari. The company was noted for using a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout. Lamborghini grew
        rapidly during its first decade, but sales plunged in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil
        crisis. The firm's ownership changed three times after 1973, including a bankruptcy in 1978. American Chrysler
        Corporation took control of Lamborghini in 1987 and sold it to Malaysian investment group Mycom Setdco and Indonesian
        group V'Power Corporation in 1994. In 1998, Mycom Setdco and V'Power sold Lamborghini to the Volkswagen Group where it
        was placed under the control of the group's Audi division.
        
        New products and model lines were introduced to the brand's portfolio and brought to the market and saw an increased
        productivity for the brand. In the late 2000s, during the worldwide financial crisis and the subsequent economic crisis,
        Lamborghini's sales saw a drop of nearly 50 per cent.</dd>
